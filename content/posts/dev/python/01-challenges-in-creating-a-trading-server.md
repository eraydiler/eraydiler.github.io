Recently, I’ve been working on a personal project: building a server to run my Pine Script strategies. The goal was to create a flexible solution that allows me to trade any strategy with any broker offering an API for developers like me. I developed the backend using Python with Flask and deployed it on Vercel.

This project was a unique challenge for me, as my background is primarily in iOS development. It also marked my first full-fledged experience with Python in a real-world project. Despite the learning curve, I’m thrilled with the outcome—I'm now able to trade seamlessly with various brokers and tones of strategies!

Along the way, I documented the challenges I faced in a series of blog posts. I hope these posts will serve as a helpful guide for both myself and others in similar situations.

Happy reading and coding ; )
